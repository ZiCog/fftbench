fftbench
========

A parallel integer only FFT for multi-core micro-controllers like the Parallax Propeller or XMOS devices.

Implementations in various languages are provided.

This may not be the smartest, fastest implementation but it has been used in benchmarking compilers/MCUs 
like GCC and Catalina C for the Propeller, Propeller Spin and PASM, XC for XMOS and so on.
